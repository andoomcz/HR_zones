Importing retrosheet data
Please follow the instructions at retrosheet website to download and use them. You will also need to install the Chadwick
software onto your computer to parse the data.

Create_Database.R
Open the create database file, and go to the BaseballSavant link that is used. Download the CSV file.
Since launch direction is not included in the CSV file (I asked them but they said no), you have to scrape it.
Run the CreateDatabase file (this takes a while)


Create_Potential_HR_DB.R
Open the create database file, and go to the BaseballSavant link that is used. Download the CSV file.
Since launch direction is not included in the CSV file (I asked them but they said no), you have to scrape it.

***Any plotting with ballparks dimensions included***
3-D visualization won't be avialable for public, as the json files are part of a private collection, and I do not own them.
